### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer (all things `#Java` `#SpringBoot` `#Microservices` `#Backend` `#APIs` `#Testing`) based in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

In todayâ€™s world, I believe most people want to help out each other. With my [blogging](https://medium.com/@truongbui95) efforts, I strive to contribute by sharing my professional experiences and the lessons Iâ€™ve learned through self-directed learning endeavors. ðŸš€

Hope itâ€™s helpful in some way ðŸ˜ƒ

Happy Sharing!
