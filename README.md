### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer (#Java #SpringBoot #Microservices #Backends #APIs #Testing) locating in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

Nowadays, I believe that most people want to help out each other so with my [blogging](https://medium.com/@truongbui95)
efforts, I try to share my knowledge, and experiences that I've faced at work or self-learning process ðŸš€

Hope it is helpful somehow.

Say hi on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buingoctruong/)
